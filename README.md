# Geo-Marker-Estimation
>The repo provides an estimate solution to finding a marker to represent a particular country just by knowing the longitude and latitude coordinates of different boundaries surrounding that country. For different countries, we have different types of terrains occupied by them. Some countries are just a single piece of land while some occupy many islands. The repo provides an 80% approximate if not 100% accurate estimation to create coordinates for a marker representing that particular country.

# Data Source:
>The geojson dataset for boundaries of the countries have been taken from the following repo: https://github.com/datasets/geo-countries

1. Since the data being displayed was too big to be displayed, thus, print statements have been inserted after each such line. It is upto the viewer to remove it if wants to view data
2. Folium Map display is not supported by Github, thus, to view version of teh repo with folium maps being displayed
